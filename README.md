SwirlingBalls
-------------

Written in Swift, this app creates a swirling flock of balls/particles that gravitate around the last touch part. It's a pretty effect that somestimes looks like bubbles and sometimes like swirling smoke. 

Created for the Swift Potluck at the NY iOS Developer Meetup on June 21, 2014 by Larry Legend.
